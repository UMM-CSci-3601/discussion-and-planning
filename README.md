# Software Design and Development discussion and planning

A place to host discussion and planning conversations for UMM's Software Design and Development class.

Feel free to use:

* [The Discussions tools](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601/discussion-and-planning/discussions) to ask general questions and discuss general aspects of the course and these labs and tools
   * As an example, this would be a good place to discuss [whether we want to switch to a monorepo organization](https://github.com/orgs/UMM-CSci-3601/discussions/2) or alternative tooling.
* [The Issues tools](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601/discussion-and-planning/issues) to create and manage "all-course" issues or issues that otherwise span multiple labs or repositories
   * As an example, this would include "big" things like "Update to Angular 473" or things that affect multiple labs like "Replace use of `+` to append strings in JS/TS with template strings".
